This is a straightforward biographical query requesting identification and background information about this individual.\n\n## Core Components\n\n1. **Identity**: Who is this person?\n2. **Professional Background**: What are his credentials and expertise?\n3. **Career History**: What roles has he held?\n4. **Current Status**: What is he doing now?\n5. **Contributions**: What is he known for?\n\n## Constraints & Considerations\n\n- Query contains a spelling variation that needs clarification\n- Search results primarily reference Tesla AI director role\n- Multiple search results mention different individuals with similar names (e.g., Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer, Kalpathy Sundaram)\n- Need to ensure we identify the correct person\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n- Name spelling ambiguity in the query\n- Potential confusion with other researchers sharing similar surnames\n- Time-sensitive information (departure from Tesla occurred in mid-July 2022, now November 2025)\n\n## Strategic Direction\n\nProvide a comprehensive biography focused on:\n1. Correct identification and background\n2. His role at Tesla and AI expertise\n3. His educational contributions\n4. His current activities as of late 2025\n5. Clarify any name spelling issues\n\n---\n\n## Answer\n\n**Andrej Karpathy** (sometimes spelled Karpathy) is a prominent artificial intelligence researcher and computer scientist who served as Tesla's AI director.[1] He is best known for his work in deep learning, neural networks, and computer vision, particularly his expertise in convolutional neural networks (CNNs).[5]\n\n## Professional Background\n\nKarpathy is recognized as an accomplished researcher in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. He taught CS231n, a Stanford computer science course on Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition, which became influential in the computer vision field.[5] At Tesla, he worked on advancing autonomous driving technology and the full self-driving (FSD) software development.[1]\n\n## Career Transition\n\nIn mid-July 2022, Karpathy announced his departure from Tesla, which raised concerns about potential delays in the company's full self-driving software launch.[1] Following his exit from Tesla, he transitioned into content creation and education, launching a YouTube channel where he has shared educational videos on AI and machine learning topics, including videos on neural networks and backpropagation.[1] This move into educational content and online influence represented a significant shift in his career trajectory."

        "content": "# Why Today's College Graduates Struggle to Land Jobs Compared to 2018\n\n## The Unemployment Crisis: By the Numbers\n\nToday's recent college graduates face a dramatically different employment landscape than their 2018 counterparts. The data reveals a stark deterioration in job prospects for this demographic.\n\n| Metric | 2018 | 2025 (Jan-July Avg) | Change |\n|--------|------|-------------------|--------|\n| Recent College Graduate Unemployment (ages 23-27) | ~2.9% | 4.59% | +1.70 pp |\n| Overall Unemployment Rate | ~3.9% | 4.18% | +0.28 pp |\n| College Grad vs. High School Grad Gap | 30-year high advantage | 30-year low advantage | Narrowing significantly |\n\nThe unemployment rate for recent college graduates has increased by approximately 1.7 percentage points since 2018—more than five times the increase in the overall unemployment rate. Even more concerning, by March 2025, the unemployment rate for recent college graduates (ages 22-27) reached 5.8%, marking the highest level since October 2013 (excluding the pandemic period)[1][2].\n\n## The Erosion of the College Advantage\n\nHistorically, a college degree provided substantial protection against unemployment. This advantage has dramatically eroded. The gap between bachelor's degree holders and workers with only a high school diploma has narrowed to its smallest in 30 years[3]. In 2019, young college-educated workers had unemployment rates 1.34 percentage points lower than their 2025 counterparts, while the advantage over high school graduates has shrunk from historical norms of 3.4 percentage points to just 1.1 percentage points as of March 2025[1][2].\n\n| Demographic Group | 2019 Average | 2025 Average (Jan-July) | Percentage Point Change |\n|-------------------|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Recent College Graduates | 3.25% | 4.59% | +1.34 |\n| Older College Graduates | 2.04% | 2.42% | +0.38 |\n| Young Noncollege-Educated Workers | 5.91% | 6.38% | +0.47 |\n\nYoung college graduates have borne the brunt of labor market shifts—their unemployment increased more than three times faster than noncollege-educated workers in the same age range[1].\n\n## Why Entry-Level Jobs Are Disappearing\n\n### The Experience Requirement Barrier\n\nA fundamental structural shift has occurred: employers are increasingly reserving even \"entry-level\" positions for candidates with three or more years of experience[3]. Total job postings in key sectors have remained flat or increased, but senior-level positions held steady, indicating a deliberate shift in hiring preferences rather than a genuine freeze[3]. This creates a catch-22 for recent graduates who cannot gain experience without entry-level opportunities.\n\n### Technology and Disruption\n\nWhite-collar occupations, traditionally strongholds for college graduates, face mounting pressure. Workers in computer occupations—historically enjoying very low unemployment—saw their unemployment rate jump from 1.98% in 2019 to 3.02% in 2025, a 1.04 percentage point increase[1]. Arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media occupations experienced even steeper declines, with unemployment rates spiking by 1.77 percentage points[1].\n\n## Underemployment: The Hidden Crisis\n\nEven when recent graduates secure employment, the jobs often don't match their qualifications. For the Class of 2023, **52% were underemployed one year after graduation**, working in positions that didn't require a degree[3]. This underemployment is particularly severe in fields like engineering, where more than one in four graduates are working outside their field[3].\n\n**Why this matters**: Early-career underemployment can trap graduates in lower-paying roles with fewer advancement opportunities, stalling career progression and skill development for years.\n\n## Rising Job Instability\n\nLayoffs among recent graduates have nearly doubled since before the pandemic, with young graduates in AI-exposed sectors like tech and finance facing especially high layoff rates compared to older degree holders[3]. A job loss early in a career creates long-term consequences—resume gaps and difficulty re-entering a competitive job market compound over time.\n\n## The Labor Force Participation Decline\n\nBeyond unemployment, labor force participation has declined. Participation rates dropped from 62.6% in April 2025 to 62.2% in July 2025, suggesting some graduates are exiting the job search entirely and becoming classified as \"out of the labor force\" rather than unemployed[1].\n\n## The Longer-Term Structural Problem\n\nThis isn't a temporary downturn. A critical mismatch is emerging: the working-age population is projected to remain stable over the next decade, while the number of college-educated adults continues rising. By 2034, there could be 7–11 million more graduates competing for degree-relevant roles[3]. The traditional labor market advantage of a college degree is structurally weakening as supply increases while demand for entry-level, degree-specific positions stagnates.\n\nThe fundamental shift from 2018 involves employers becoming more selective, favoring experienced candidates, technology disrupting white-collar work, and an oversupply of degree holders chasing increasingly scarce entry-level positions—a combination that has fundamentally altered the post-college employment landscape."
